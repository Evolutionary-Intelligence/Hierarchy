  * "Evolution is categorized by several levels of hierarchy: the gene, the chromosome, the individual, the species, and the ecosystem. Thus there is an inevitable choice that must be made when constructing a simulation of evolution. Inevitably, attention must be focused at a particular level in the hierarchy, and the remainder of the simulation is to some extent determined by that perspective. Ultimately, the question that must be answered is, “What exactly is being evolved?” All the symptoms of the simulation will reflect the answer to this question, whether by conscious design or not. If intelligence is viewed in terms of adaptation, then the answer to the question must be that what is evolved is functional behavior. To construct a useful model, evolution must be abstracted in terms of the behavioral relationships between units of evolution, rather than the mechanisms that give rise to these relationships."
